1. Data Setup:
The books array holds book objects with properties like id, name, and quantity. We also initialize two arrays:

issuedBooksArray to store issued books.
returnedBooksArray to store books that are returned.
2. Display Books (displayBooks function):
This function displays the books in a table on the web page.

It first clears the existing content in the table, then loops over each book in the books array (this is iteration).
For each book, it creates a row and adds the book’s id, name, and quantity into that row.
This function is updating the display each time it’s called.
3. Search for a Book (searchBook function):
This function performs a linear search to find a book by id or name.

The function takes user input from searchInput and converts it to lowercase for easier matching.
It uses the find() method to look through each book in the books array (linear search) and checks if:
The id matches exactly, or
The name includes the search term.
If a match is found, it shows the book’s details; otherwise, it shows “Book Not Found!”
4. Add a Book (addBook function):
This function inserts a new book into the books array or updates an existing book’s quantity.

It takes input for the new book’s ID, name, and quantity.
Then it searches (using find()) to see if the book ID already exists in the books array (linear search).
If it exists, it updates the existing book’s quantity by adding the new quantity.
If it doesn’t exist, it inserts the new book into the books array using push().
Finally, it calls displayBooks() to update the book list on the page.
5. Issue a Book (issueBook function):
This function removes one from the quantity of a book in the books array and adds it to the issuedBooksArray.

It gets the student’s name and the book ID from input fields.
It then finds the book in the books array (linear search).
If the book is available (quantity > 0), it decreases the book’s quantity by 1.
It also inserts a new entry into issuedBooksArray with the student’s name, book ID, and book name.
After updating, it calls displayBooks() and updateIssuedBooksList() to refresh the view.
6. Return a Book (returnBook function):
This function removes a book from issuedBooksArray and adds it to returnedBooksArray.

It gets the return details (book ID and student name).
It finds the issued book’s entry in issuedBooksArray (linear search with findIndex()).
If found, it removes it from issuedBooksArray using splice() and inserts it into returnedBooksArray.
It then finds the matching book in the books array and updates its quantity by increasing it by 1.
The function then calls displayBooks() and updateReturnedBooksList() to update the view.
7. Update Issued Books List (updateIssuedBooksList function):
This function displays all books currently issued.

It clears the existing list of issued books, then loops through each entry in issuedBooksArray.
It creates a list item for each issued book and displays the book name, ID, and student name.
8. Update Returned Books List (updateReturnedBooksList function):
This function displays all books that have been returned.

It clears the existing list of returned books, then loops through each entry in returnedBooksArray.
It creates a list item for each returned book with the book name, ID, and student name.
Summary of Array Operations:
Insert: New books are added to books in addBook(), issued books are added to issuedBooksArray, and returned books to returnedBooksArray.
Delete: An issued book is removed from issuedBooksArray when it’s returned.
Update: Book quantities are updated in books when books are issued or returned.
Linear Search: find() and findIndex() perform linear searches on books and issuedBooksArray to locate specific entries.
This code provides a basic library management system using simple array operations and linear search.
